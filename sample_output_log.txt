Thank you for your patience. Fishy & Co. Rain Predictor v1.0 is ready!

What is the cost per fishing trip? ($'000):
What is the revenue (gross) from the haul per fishing trip? ($'000):
Based on your input that each trip cost $2,000 and will make us $4,000,
each successful fishing trip will make us a profit of $2,000.

What do you wish to pick the model based on? (Select a nuumber)
	1. Profit-generating potential
	2. Model's Accuracy
	3. Model's F1-Score
Thank you, please wait while we evaluate the results.

# END NOTE
==================================================
Please note that this is a beta-test of the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for Fishy & Co. rain predictor.
In a fully-developed pipeline with the selection model, the selected model will be pickled for reusability.
An additional pipeline to take the 'unseen' dataset and generate the predicted labels will be built for the working version.

Thank you,
